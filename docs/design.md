# Keylogger Monitor GUI - Design Documentation

## üèó Architecture

The Keylogger Monitor GUI is a desktop application built using Python and Tkinter. It is designed to provide a graphical interface for managing and viewing keylogger data. The application follows a straightforward design to ensure ease of use and clarity.

### *Components*

1. *Main Window*
   - *Title*: Displays the name of the application.
   - *Time Label*: Provides instructions for entering the date and time.
   - *Date and Time Selector*: Dropdown menus for selecting year, month, day, hour, and minute.
   - *Search Button*: Initiates the search for keylogger data based on the selected timestamp.
   - *Delete Button*: Removes keylogger data for the current timestamp.
   - *Scrollable Canvas*: Displays keylogger data with vertical and horizontal scrollbars.

2. *Layout*
   - *Title Label* is centered at the top of the window.
   - *Time Label* and *Date and Time Selector* are aligned horizontally.
   - *Search Button* and *Delete Button* are positioned below the time selection controls, with the delete button on the left.
   - *Scrollable Canvas* occupies the main area below the buttons and adjusts with window resizing.

### *User Interface Design*

- *Color Scheme*: The application uses a light background (#f0f0f0) with contrasting text colors to ensure readability.
- *Fonts*: 
  - Title: Helvetica, 30pt, bold
  - Labels and Buttons: Arial, 12pt
- *Button Sizes*: Buttons are designed to be sufficiently large to accommodate user interaction, with specific widths to ensure consistency.

### *Interaction Flow*

1. *Selecting Date and Time*: Users select the desired date and time from the dropdown menus.
2. *Searching Data*: The user clicks the "Search" button to display keylogger events for the selected timestamp.
3. *Deleting Data*: The user clicks the "Delete" button to remove data for the current timestamp.
4. *Viewing Data*: The scrollable canvas displays the keylogger data, allowing users to scroll through it as needed.

## üõ† Future Enhancements

- *Advanced Filtering*: Allow users to filter data based on additional criteria.
- *Export Options*: Provide functionality to export data to various formats (CSV, PDF).
- *Improved Error Handling*: Enhance user feedback and error reporting mechanisms.
